* Load the source into your workspace;
* Select "Export > Deployable plug-ins and fragments";
* Mark the checkbox next to the org.eclipselabs.windowsizer plug-in;
* Select "Install into host"
* Click "Finish"

##Support

Note that this not an official Eclipse plug-in produced by an Eclipse open source project.
